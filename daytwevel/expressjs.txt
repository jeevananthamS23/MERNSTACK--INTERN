* express is framework library of nodejs.

* Express.js
Express.js is a web framework built on top of Node.js.
It simplifies creating a server and handling requests like “What to do when someone visits a webpage or sends data?”

Why use Express.js?

Simplifies Routing:

Handles routes like /home, /login, /users easily.
You don’t need to write complex logic yourself.
Middleware Support:

You can add features like logging, authentication, or error handling with middleware.
Lightweight and Flexible:

It doesn’t force you to use specific tools or libraries—use only what you need.
RESTful APIs Made Easy:

Express.js is great for creating APIs to connect your backend with a frontend (e.g., React, Angular) or mobile app.
Example Use Case:
In a food delivery app:

Node.js ensures the app is fast and handles multiple user requests at once.
Express.js makes it easy to define routes like:
/menu to show food items.
/order to place an order.
/track to track delivery.



* Key Difference: Node.js vs. Express.js
Node.js: Provides the engine to run JavaScript on the server and handle requests.
Express.js: Makes it easier to organize and handle those requests by adding routing and middleware support.
