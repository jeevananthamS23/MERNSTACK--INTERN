Node.js is a runtime environment that lets you run JavaScript on the server (not just in the browser).
Why use Node.js?

Fast and Scalable:

Handles thousands of user requests at the same time without slowing down.
Perfect for apps like real-time chats, live streaming, or APIs.
Single Language (JavaScript):

You can use the same language (JavaScript) for both the frontend and backend.
Non-blocking I/O:

It doesn’t “pause” while waiting for a task like reading files or talking to a database.
This makes it faster compared to traditional server languages like PHP.
Rich Ecosystem with npm:

Node.js has a huge library of pre-built tools and packages to make development faster.
Example Use Case:
Imagine a real-time chat app. Node.js ensures all users can send and receive messages quickly without delay.
